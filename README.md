Hi, I'm Matheus, a very communicative scientist who believes that this is a relevant virtue not only for research teams but also for development teams, as communication, for teamwork, is essential. However, I consider curiosity to be my fundamental characteristic and, like a good scientist, the effort within that curiosity 🔭🌱.

I'm passionate about the idea of ​​being able to simulate natural phenomena from my small laptop on the table in my room, it's like having a small part of the world in my private world. I am currently finishing my master's project in the area of ​​quantum computing simulation. This project is focused on developing an open-source scientific package for the fast and accurate simulation of the time-independent wavefunction of a Quantum Harmonic Oscillator, a model widely used in Photonic Quantum Computing. The name of this package is Fast Wave.
