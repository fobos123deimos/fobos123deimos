Hi, I'm Matheus, a very communicative scientist who believes that this is a relevant virtue not only for research teams but also for development teams, as communication, for teamwork, is essential. However, I consider curiosity to be my fundamental characteristic and, like a good scientist, the effort within that curiosity üî≠üå±.

üíª‚öõÔ∏è Computational Physics

I'm passionate about simulating natural phenomena from my small laptop on the table in my room, it's like having a small part of the world in my private world. I am currently finishing my master's project in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãquantum computing simulation. This project is focused on developing an open-source scientific package for the fast and accurate simulation of the time-independent wavefunction of a Quantum Harmonic Oscillator, a model widely used in Photonic Quantum Computing. The name of this package is [Fast Wave](https://pypi.org/project/fast-wave/).

üíªüéÆ Game Development

Currently, I am a partner in a startup with my friends, which is part of the [PEPITE Normandie Incubator in France](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pepite-normandie/posts/?feedView=all), in the gaming area, named [SeaFortress](https://beacons.ai/seafortress/home). It is focused on the use of Artificial Intelligence in computer games. We already have games published on Steam and have participated twice in international indie game competitions, improving our ranking. This is one of our games on Steam: [EnjoyTyping](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/1956410/):

- [FluffeyPanda's World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odeQ9Qs_zio&t=14s)

We are developing a second game that is the first to use Unity's newest library for Artificial Intelligence, Sentis, in the context of Computer Vision. This game already has a demo on Steam and is called [PlinioNeedsAHand](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2671760/Plinio_Needs_a_Hand/). It was so relevant to the Unity developers that it was showcased at GDC, which is the largest indie game exhibition in the world, and on Unity's channel:

I handle all aspects of Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning and Deep Learning). Our motto is: Strong Games with Smooth Gameplays, and our guiding principle is to adapt our work to our professional lives so that both can flow perfectly. The startup adapts to life and not the other way around; both should yield results.

üíªüß† Artificial Intelligence

I have a lot of experience with artificial intelligence research, as I have been researching this area since I entered university. After two years of Scientific Initiation scholarship, two years of project scholarship, four years as a research volunteer, and a few months as an AI developer, I accumulated some publications and works in the area:
