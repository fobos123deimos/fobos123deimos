I'm a very communicative scientist who believes that this is a relevant virtue not only for research teams but also for development teams, as communication, for teamwork, is essential. However, I consider curiosity to be my fundamental characteristic and, like a good scientist, the effort within that curiosity 🔭🌱.

## 💻⚛️ Computational Physics
---

I am passionate about simulating natural phenomena from my small laptop — it's like having a small part of the universe inside my room.

My latest project focused on the development of an open-source scientific package for the **fast and accurate simulation of the time-independent wavefunction of a Quantum Harmonic Oscillator**, a model widely used in **Photonic Quantum Computing**. This package, called [**Fast Wave**](https://pypi.org/project/fast-wave/), was developed as part of my master's research, which is now completed.

## 💻🎮 Game Development
---

I am the co-founder of an indie game and AI studio called [**SeaFortress**](https://beacons.ai/seafortress/home), part of the [**PEPITE Normandie Incubator**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pepite-normandie/posts/?feedView=all).

We develop indie games with a strong focus on integrating Artificial Intelligence into gameplay and mechanics. Our games are published on Steam, and we have participated twice in international indie game competitions.

- [**FluffeyPanda's World (Gameplay)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odeQ9Qs_zio&t=14s)

We're currently developing [**Plinio Needs a Hand**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2671760/Plinio_Needs_a_Hand/), the first game to use **Unity Sentis**, Unity’s AI library for Computer Vision. This game was showcased at:

- [**GDC 2024**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7176392039217934336/)
- [**Unity Channel (YouTube)**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uU_TxSyINI&t=787s)
- [**Unity Unite**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-sbHvDF6Bw&t=474s)

I handle all AI-related aspects (Machine Learning and Deep Learning). Our philosophy is: **"Strong Games with Smooth Gameplays"**, and we believe that work should adapt to life, not the other way around.

## 💻🧠 Artificial Intelligence and Data Science
---

My journey in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science blends research, applied development, and production-ready solutions.

I specialize in:

- ✅ **Risk Modeling and Validation**, including Credit Risk, Operational Risk, Market Risk, Microcredit, and Climate & Environmental Risk.
- ✅ Development of **challenger models** using techniques like **MLP, XGBoost, LightGBM, XGBSE**, and clustering algorithms such as **KMeans, PAM, CLARA**.
- ✅ Implementation of probabilistic models like **Value at Risk (VaR)** and **RAROC**.
- ✅ **Anomaly detection systems**, particularly for event logs using machine learning algorithms like **Isolation Forest**.
- ✅ Advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** applied to trajectory prediction with **Transformer models (Huggingface)**, treating sequences of geospatial points as sentences.
- ✅ Model Governance, Reproducibility, EDA, Benchmarking, Feature Engineering, and Model Performance Evaluation.
- ✅ Proficient in **Python**, **R**, **SQL**, and distributed systems with tools like **RabbitMQ** and **ElasticSearch**.

### 🔬 Some of my published research:

- *Smart Farming with Deep Neural Networks:* [DOI](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167739X21004428?via%3Dihub)  
- *Trajectory Modeling via NLP:* [DOI](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/19/7475) — [**Teach GitHub**](https://github.com/InsightLab/teach)
